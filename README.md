At least for now, the repository is **unmaintained**. [![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This plugin is providing support for OCaml for JetBrains IDEs. It's based on both ReasonML and intellij-rust. If you are looking for a complete and maintained solution, please check out the [ReasonML](https://github.com/giraud/reasonml-idea-plugin) plugin (that is based on [ocaml-ide](https://github.com/sidharthkuruvila/ocaml-ide) btw). I'm a student, and I'm lacking the knowledge to do something great.
