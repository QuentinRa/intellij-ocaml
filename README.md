At least for now, the repository is **unmaintained**. [![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This plugin is providing support for OCaml for JetBrains IDEs. It's based on both ReasonML and intellij-rust. If you are looking for a complete and maintained solution, please check out the [ReasonML](https://github.com/giraud/reasonml-idea-plugin) plugin (that is based on [ocaml-ide](https://github.com/sidharthkuruvila/ocaml-ide) btw). I'm a student, and I'm lacking the knowledge to do something great.

## Plugin Features Overview

The goal is to have a plugin similar to VSCode with OCaml LSP server, but without the LSP server as it is not fully available for plugin developers yet, and as it exclusive to paid users.

**Base features** (✅ = YES, ❌ = No/Not yet, 🆗 = Must compile first)

|                           | OCaml | ReasonML | VSCode        | VSCode LSP |

| OCamlFormat | ❌     | ✅        | ✅      |

## 🎯 What's my goal?

* [ ] Can run/compile ocaml files (without having to install some external build system)
* [ ] Support for opam (can install / update packages, ...)
* [ ] Support for Makefile
* [ ] Support for Dune
* [x] Any installation must be simple, and effortless
* [ ] **Real-time checks for errors/warnings**, including quick fixes. Can suppress warnings.
* [x] **Real-time type inference**
* [ ] **Smart auto-completion**
* [x] **REPL support**: we must be able to send commands from our file, to a REPL console
* [x] **Using a bundle** (possible support for Localization later)
* [x] Working in minor IDEs (CLion, PHPStorm, etc.)
