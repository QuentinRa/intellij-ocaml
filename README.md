# OCaml plugin IntelliJ

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This plugin is based on [ReasonML](https://github.com/giraud/reasonml-idea-plugin), but **I'm tuning it for my personal use**. **I'm not planning to maintain this repository**, so you should work on the original plugin.

> **Created on**: Windows 10/11 for IntelliJ<br>
> **Goal**: easy to install, complete, compatible in minor IDE, OCaml only. Use WSL+opam on Windows.
