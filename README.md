At least for now, the repository is **unmaintained**. [![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This plugin is providing support for OCaml for JetBrains IDEs. It's based on both ReasonML and intellij-rust. If you are looking for a complete and maintained solution, please check out the [ReasonML](https://github.com/giraud/reasonml-idea-plugin) plugin (that is based on [ocaml-ide](https://github.com/sidharthkuruvila/ocaml-ide) btw). I'm a student, and I'm lacking the knowledge to do something great.

## Current Progress Of The Rework

**Goal**: implement the least feature to have a working plugin using the new parser. This is PoC to test if we can use JetBrains Grammar File.

Internal

  * [x] Add some pins
    * [ ] Add more pins
    * [ ] Verify pins
  * [ ] Parser Errors are not handled
  * [ ] Parser recovery is not handled
  * [ ] Parser tests were not implemented
  * [ ] Handle visibility (Has MLI? Has VAL? etc. ==> related: icons and structure view)
* [ ] Stubs
  * [x] Add Stubs For Variables
  * [ ] Use stubs in structure view
  * [x] Do not store anonymous variables
* [ ] Indexes
  * [x] Add indexes for variables
  * [ ] Indexes include nested variables (Scopes?)
  * [ ] Use an index of integers?
* [ ] GitHub CI

  * [X] Line Markers
    * [X] Declaration
    * [x] Implementation
    * [x] Show a nice presentation
    * [x] Works with pattern variables (ex: "a,b,c")

  * [X] Color Settings Page For Highlighter
  * [x] Add Highlighter Annotator to Color Settings Page

**Roadmap I**

* Modules (files) indexes
* Handle Include and Open
  * [ ] Line Markers?
* Check completion
* Check folding
* Find usages

* Can compile using dune (.gitignore? etc.)
* Can display warnings/errors
* Can generate annot file
* Can use annot for type inference
* Space allowed (spaceExistenceTypeBetweenTokens)
* Better stubs (skipChildProcessingWhenBuildingStubs)

**Roadmap III**

* Ensure parser works on 0Caml 4.14 Code
* Ensure parser works on 0Caml 4.13 Code
* Ensure parser works on 0Caml 4.12 Code
* Ensure parser works on 0Caml 4.11 Code
* Ensure parser works on 0Caml 4.10 Code

**Roadmap III#Testing**

* Add parser tests

Random

* Let#isFunction: use type inference?

Generalization List

* [x] Let
* [x] Val
* [ ] Exception
* [ ] Type
* [ ] Module
* [ ] Module Type

Generalize steps

* [ ] Add stubs for others
* [ ] Add structure view for others
* [ ] Add indexes for others
* [ ] Add colors (settings+annotator) for others
* [ ] Ensure everything anonymous is correctly handled (stubs, structure view, etc.)

* [ ] Can run/compile ocaml files (without having to install some external build system)
* [ ] Support for opam (can install / update packages, ...)
* [ ] Support for Makefile
* [ ] Support for Dune
* [x] Any installation must be simple, and effortless
* [ ] **Real-time checks for errors/warnings**, including quick fixes. Can suppress warnings.
* [x] **Real-time type inference**
* [ ] **Smart auto-completion**
* [x] **REPL support**: we must be able to send commands from our file, to a REPL console
* [x] **Using a bundle** (possible support for Localization later)
* [x] Working in minor IDEs (CLion, PHPStorm, etc.)
