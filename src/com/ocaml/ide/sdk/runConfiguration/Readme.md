# Notes

- we should be able to pick the "output" folder
  - it means that we may have to use the flag "-i"
- we should be able to define "dependencies".
- the current directory is hard-coded
- we can compile, but it does not run the program
- errors aren't properly handled (exit code OK, message OK but in white, not in red/something). We should have a "build" menu, right?
