### 1. Native SDK (non-opam users only)

* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get upgrade`
* `sudo apt-get install ocaml`

### 2. Configure opam (opam users only)

* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get install opam`
* `opam init`
* `opam switch create 4.13.0` to install ocaml 4.13.0. Press "y" when prompted.
* `eval $(opam env)`
