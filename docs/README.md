OCaml is a plugin based on ReasonML and Rust, compatible with every IDE made by JetBrains (IntelliJ, CLion, ...). You can find the source code [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuentinRa/intellij-ocaml). The goal of the plugin is to give OCaml users a complete set of features allowing them to write OCaml applications with ease. **As of now, the plugin still needs a lot of work in order to be usable, but with help, feedback, and time, I should be able to make something great.**

Please note that I, QuentinRa, the main and only developer of this plugin, am only a (French) student, so I'm still learning and new to a lot of things...
